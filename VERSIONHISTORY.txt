	v0.0 - 28/02/2015

		After creating the private Git repo for this project. I decided that it
		would be best to get started right away on the two documents that were
		uploaded to Myplace:
			- Programming Assignment 1: Building a Multi-Threaded Web Server
			- Programming Assignment 7: Streaming Video with RTSP and RTP
		Since there was no official specification for the assignment, it was
		decided to do as much of this in order to make the actual assignment
		easier.	
	
	v0.1 - 28/02/2015
		
		Implemented Part A of Assignment 1, but it needs to be tested. I'm
		currently unsure as to if DEVWEB will be required for this part or not,
		due to how the document describes the assignment at hand.
	
	v0.2 - 09/03/2015
	
		Realised I've just to use localhost for it, derp. Moved the HttpRequest
		stuff into it's own class, makes more sense to me. Fixed the general
		stupidity.
	
	v0.3 - 10/03/2015
	
		Created the ServerIO class, which allows me to handle closing everything
		down better. This class and the WebServer are run concurrently to allow
		for smooth listening etc. The Server class allows for managing both
		these classes side by side, with the new Driver creating it all. 


	v1.0 - 17/03/2015

		Extensive refactoring of HttpRequest and the addition of an index.html
		file just to makes thing a bit nicer and such. So right now pretty much
		all I have is a web server. Which is kinda nice I suppose. Now I need
		to make it a caching proxy server, horray.

	v1.1 - 26/03/2015
	
		This was primarily just cleaning things up. Added a 404.html file since
		it didn't seem right having it just be a string in the source. Plan now
		is to include a logger to log everything being requested by clients.
