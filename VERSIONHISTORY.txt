Version 0.0: Basic Multithreaded Web Server
Commenced:   28/02/2015
Finished:    17/03/2015

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	v0.0 - 28/02/2015

		After creating the private Git repo for this project. I decided that it
		would be best to get started right away on the two documents that were
		uploaded to Myplace:
			- Programming Assignment 1: Building a Multi-Threaded Web Server
			- Programming Assignment 7: Streaming Video with RTSP and RTP
		Since there was no official specification for the assignment, it was
		decided to do as much of this in order to make the actual assignment
		easier.	
	
	v0.1 - 28/02/2015
		
		Implemented Part A of Assignment 1, but it needs to be tested. I'm
		currently unsure as to if DEVWEB will be required for this part or not,
		due to how the document describes the assignment at hand.
	
	v0.2 - 09/03/2015
	
		Realised I've just to use localhost for it, derp. Moved the HttpRequest
		stuff into it's own class, makes more sense to me. Fixed the general
		stupidity.
	
	v0.3 - 10/03/2015
	
		Created the ServerIO class, which allows me to handle closing everything
		down better. This class and the WebServer are run concurrently to allow
		for smooth listening etc. The Server class allows for managing both
		these classes side by side, with the new Driver creating it all. 


	v1.0 - 17/03/2015

		Extensive refactoring of HttpRequest and the addition of an index.html
		file just to makes thing a bit nicer and such. So right now pretty much
		all I have is a web server. Which is kinda nice I suppose. Now I need
		to make it a caching proxy server, horray. Added a 404.html file since
		it didn't seem right having it just be a string in the source.

Version 1.0: Caching and Forwarding Web Proxy Server
Commenced:   20/04/2015 (Please don't murder me for the gap)
Finished:    -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	v1.1 - 20/04/2015
	
		Added a basic forwarding system that works for basic pages. Images, CSS
		and JavaScript are basically not going to happen though, bear that in
		mind at this current stage. I need to add basic caching now before
		making the proxy more sophisticated.
	
	v1.2 - 24/04/2015
		
		Better forwarding, can now forward images, stylesheets and scripts.
		Having some issues with redirecting to 404 pages on a website and such
		however, need to deal with that.
		
	v1.3 - 25/05/2015
	
		Caching works. However, URLs that consist of illegal file characters
		currently do not work now, need to deal with, seems they don't even
		forward now, which is a bit annoying.
		
	v.1.31 - 25/05/2015
	
		Changed how saving the local file works, now the hash code of the url
		is used for storage. This has advantages of:
			- Characters like "?" will not cause the operating system to forbid
			  the file from being created.
			- Long URLs will be shortened while retaining uniqueness.
	
	v1.4 - 25/05/2015
	
		Restructure of the code saw generating the filename from the URL moved
		into it's own method, and changed from using hash codes to back to just
		using the URL instead using a regex to filter out the dodgy stuff.
		
	v1.5 - 26/05/2015
	
		Tidied stuff up, I think this is done as good as I can make it. It
		caches, it proxies, standard websites work without a huff.
